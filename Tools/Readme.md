##Windows Service Manager (SrvMan)
[Windows Service Manager](http://tools.sysprogs.org/srvman/) is a small tool that simplifies all common tasks related to Windows services. It can create services (both Win32 and Legacy Driver) without restarting Windows, delete existing services and change service configuration. It has both GUI and Command-line modes. It can also be used to run arbitrary Win32 applications as services (when such service is stopped, main application window is closed automatically).
